### Single purpose
"Capture and organize web bookmarks efficiently with AI-assisted categorization, search, and management."

### Permissions justification
- `storage`: save settings and auth/session metadata locally
- `scripting`: on-demand injection fallback when manual capture is triggered
- `activeTab`: capture current page content only on user action
- `commands`: keyboard shortcut for one-key save
- `notifications`: show fallback/error notifications when page injection is unavailable
- `alarms`: schedule background jobs for sync/cleanup/backfill
- `identity`: Google OAuth login via Chrome identity flow
- `host_permissions: http://*/*, https://*/*`: display QuickDock consistently on regular web pages
- `content_scripts (http/https)`: inject local QuickDock UI and page-capture helpers
- `permissions`: request optional site access at runtime per configured API origin
- `optional_host_permissions: https://*/*`: only used for runtime origin grants (for user-configured AI/Supabase domains)

Security behavior:
- Broad web-page access is used only to render the on-page QuickDock experience.
- AI/Supabase requests still rely on user-configured domains (e.g. `https://api.openai.com/*`, `https://<project>.supabase.co/*`).

### Remote code declaration
- Select: No remote code execution.
- Reason: extension fetches remote APIs only; it does not download and execute remote scripts.

### Data usage declaration (suggested)
Collects and processes:
- Website content selected/captured by user action
- Bookmark metadata (url/title/domain/tags/category/notes)
- Account identifier for sync

Not sold to third parties.
Not used for ads, credit, or lending.
Used only for core bookmark and sync functionality.

### Privacy policy URL
Use your deployed policy page URL (must be public), for example:
- `https://bridge.musemark.app/privacy.html`

## 6) Distribution recommendation for first release
